# T-xy Diagram Generator for Binary Solutions (Personal Project)
A Python program that produces the T-xy diagram of a binary mixture of two chosen liquid species. Computes **Bubble-Point** and **Dew-Point** curves using numerical methods.

## Background & Scientific Principles
A **T-xy diagram** displays the mole composition (in both liquid and vapour phase) of a binary mixture (two species) at different temperatures and a constant pressure. The key principles applied in my code are the **Ideal Gas Law**, **Raoult's Law**, and the **Antoine Equation**. These three principles effectively describe the relation between several properties of liquids and their respective vapours in a system at phase equilibrium (pressure, temperature, mole fraction). 

## Features
1. A binary mixture can be inputted by selecting the first and second liquid species from a list of various different liquids (the first species selected, whose mole composition is in the horizontal axis of the diagram, should convetionally be the more volatile species)
2. A 
3. The bubble-point and dew-point temperatures are calculated at
