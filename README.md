# T-xy Diagram Generator for Binary Solutions (Personal Project)

## Motivation & Scientific Principles
I was motivated to begin this project as a means of deepening my understanding of **binary vapour liquid equilibria**(a concept relevant to Chemical Engineering) and to improve my Python programming ability. The key principles applied in my code are the **Ideal Gas Law**, **Raoult's Law**, and the **Antoine Equation**. These three principles effectively describe the relation between several properties of liquids and their respective vapours at phase equilibrium (pressure, temperature, mole fraction).
